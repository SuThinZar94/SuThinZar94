ðŸ‘‹ About Me

From Yangon to Bangkok, my journey has always been about turning curiosity into impact.

Over the past 10+ years, Iâ€™ve grown from a marketing executive into a Marketing Manager leading integrated campaigns, performance marketing, and analytics. At Proximity Designs, I helped reposition Yetagon from a product-focused irrigation brand into a trusted agronomy partner â€” driving brand awareness from 11% to 64% in rural markets. Iâ€™ve managed campaigns that delivered measurable ROI, built reporting frameworks that cut manual work by 80%, and uncovered insights that shaped leadership decisions.

Along the way, I earned my MBA with Merit from the University of Sunderland, and was honored as a YSEALI Professional Fellow under the U.S. Department of State â€” experiences that strengthened both my technical expertise and my commitment to using knowledge for positive change.

Currently upskilling in:

 - Machine Learning foundations and applications for marketing & social impact
 
 - Performance Marketing Analytics (GA4, BigQuery, Attribution Modeling)
 
 - Power BI & Excel for dashboards and insights
 
 - SQL & Python for marketing data analysis
 
 - AI tools for content, campaigns, and predictive insights

Passions
I believe every dataset tells a story and I love transforming those stories into decisions that grow brands and empower people. Now, Iâ€™m deepening my path into Machine Learning and AI, with the goal of applying data-driven solutions to both business growth and community development.

I am also a member of Women in AI Myanmar, contributing to a growing network of women driving AI innovation and knowledge-sharing in Myanmar.

As a woman from Myanmar working in tech and analytics, I carry not only my own ambition but also the drive to help open doors for other women and youth in developing countries. My goal is to keep learning, adapting, and sharing knowledge so the next generation of women in tech feels seen, capable, and unstoppable.

Always curious. Always learning. Always ready to thrive.
